Short list of design goals:The Website will serve as a review blogsite..The website will have a clean layout and be easy to read through use of white on black text.
The website will use a drop down menu in order to reduce site cluster and make use on smaller devices easier.
The css should adapt to the size of the display window.

Additional plans:
. Sitemap either contained in a site directory on all pages or contained in a dedicated page
. A sample review page which can be used as a base to create future pages when the site goes live or more content is created
. A link on all pages to their relevant validation page this makes it easier for debugging during and post development
. a comment section which will make use of a form to take input and a JSON to store values to print on page (the form has been made alongside the JSON and return function but unfortunatly having them interact will have to be a future goal for now I have placed dummy data in the JSON as a demonstration
. some use of flexbox for formating recent releases and upcoming releases in order to allow the sections to grow by adding more smaples without mutating the design and layout.
